### Prerequisites

This config use date util, python, hyprctl (you need to make sure that you have installed it) and custom scripts, so you need to change path to scripts in hyprlock.conf and in get_current_keyboard_layout.sh

### Installing

Simply download this repo, and move hyprlock.conf to ~/.config/hypr/ and move scripts anywhere you want(don't forget to change paths)
